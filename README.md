# -Idoms-Phrases-in-English

English-language idioms. An idiom is a common word or phrase with a culturally understood meaning that differs from what its composite words' denotations would suggest. For example, an English speaker would understand the phrase "kick the bucket" to mean "to die" â€“ and also to actually kick a bucket.
